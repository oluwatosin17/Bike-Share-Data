# Bike-Share-Data

- Bike-sharing programs have grown in popularity and number in cities all around the world during the last decade. Users can borrow bicycles for a fee for a relatively short period of time through bicycle-sharing programs. People can rent a bike from point A and return it to point B, or they can return it to the same area if they merely want to go for a ride. Regardless, each bike may serve a number of people during the day.

- It is simple for a system user to reach a dock inside the system to unlock or return bicycles, thanks to the advancement of information technology. These technologies also generate a plethora of data that may be utilized to investigate how people use bike-sharing programs.

## The Datasets

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

    Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

    Gender
    Birth Year
  
  
## Statistics Computed

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

**1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)**

    most common month
    most common day of week
    most common hour of day

**2 Popular stations and trip**

    most common start station
    most common end station
    most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**3 Trip duration**

    total travel time
    average travel time

**4 User info**

    counts of each user type
    counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    
 
### How the program works is as follows:


- This is an interactive experience in which the user may ask questions regarding the dataset and receive answers.
The experience is interactive since the answers to the questions changes based on the user's interaction!

The questions that would make program interactive: 
- Which city do you want to filter by?
- Which city do you want to filter by?
- What month do you want to filter by?
- Choose a day to filter by, or just type in all to see everything
